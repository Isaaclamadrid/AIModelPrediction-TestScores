# AIModelPrediction-TestScores
This project uses Python to train a simple AI model that predicts a student’s test score based on hours studied and hours slept. The program reads data from a CSV file, trains a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn, and then makes a prediction for a sample student.

# Test Score AI Predictor
## Problem
I wanted to see if a computer could predict a student's test score based on how many hours they studied and how much sleep they got.
## Solution
This project uses a simple machine learning model called Linear Regression.
It reads training data from a CSV file, learns patterns, and predicts a test score for a student.
## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Google Sheets (to create the dataset)
## Results - Output Screenshot
The AI predicted a test score of 85.44925373134328 for a student who studied 6 hours and slept 8 hours.
## Learning
I learned how AI models train on data and how to use Python libraries to build a real machine learning project.
